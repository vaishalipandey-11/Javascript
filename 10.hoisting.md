🧠 What is Hoisting?

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code runs.
📦 In simple words:
JS remembers your variable and function names first (not values), even before the code actually runs.

| Declaration Type | Hoisted?    | Usable Before Declaration?  | Notes                       |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `var`            | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes (returns `undefined`) | Only name is hoisted        |
| `let` / `const`  | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No (TDZ error)            | Safe coding, block scoped   |
| `function`       | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes                       | Fully hoisted (declaration) |
| `function expr.` | ✅ Name only | ❌ No (TypeError)            | Treated like `var`          |
