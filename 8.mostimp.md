🧠 1. What is Synchronous? (aka Sync)
🧒 Imagine you're waiting in line for ice cream.
The man gives ice cream to one person at a time, and you have to wait your turn.
console.log("1");
console.log("2");
console.log("3");
✅ This is synchronous: code runs line by line, one after another.


🕒 2. What is Asynchronous? (aka Async)
👧 Imagine you order a pizza. It takes time to cook, but you don’t just sit and wait — you play games in the meantime.
console.log("1");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2"); // runs later
}, 2000);
console.log("3");

🍕 setTimeout() is async — it waits in the background while the rest of the code continues.

| Sync Code            | Async Code                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Blocks the next line | Doesn’t block the next line       |
| Runs in order        | Can run out of order              |
| Like waiting in line | Like ordering food & walking away |

💥 3. What is a Promise?
A Promise is like ordering something online 📦
You place an order ✅
It can either arrive (fulfilled), or fail (rejected)


let order = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let isReady = true;
  if (isReady) {
    resolve("Order received ✅");
  } else {
    reject("Order failed ❌");
  }
});

order.then((msg) => {
  console.log(msg);
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log(err);
});

| State     | Meaning                     |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| Pending   | Waiting for result          |
| Fulfilled | Done successfully (resolve) |
| Rejected  | Failed (reject)             |

✅ 4. Why Promises?
To avoid callback hell like this:
getData(function(a) {
  getMore(a, function(b) {
    getFinal(b, function(c) {
      console.log(c);
    });
  });
});

With Promise:
getData()
  .then(getMore)
  .then(getFinal)
  .then(console.log);


🌈 5. What is async/await?
It’s a prettier, easier way to write asynchronous code with Promises — it looks like sync, but it’s async behind the scenes.

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("📦 Data fetched");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function getData() {
  console.log("Getting data...");
  let result = await fetchData();  // wait here
  console.log(result);
  console.log("Done!");
}

getData();

Getting data...
📦 Data fetched
Done!


| Concept      | Meaning                                 | Code Style             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Synchronous  | Runs step-by-step, blocks everything    | Normal JS              |
| Asynchronous | Doesn’t block, runs in background       | setTimeout, fetch, etc |
| Callback     | Function passed to another function     | `fn(() => {})`         |
| Promise      | Represents future value (success/fail)  | `.then()`, `.catch()`  |
| async/await  | Cleaner promise code, looks synchronous | `await fn()`           |
