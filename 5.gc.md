🧠 What is Garbage Collection?
In JavaScript:

Garbage Collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory that is no longer needed — so your program doesn’t run out of RAM.
JavaScript does this automatically, but knowing how it works helps you:
Avoid memory leaks 🔥
Write efficient code 💡
Debug slow apps 🐌

📦 Memory in JavaScript
When you do this:

let person = { name: "Vaishali" };
Memory is allocated to store that object.

Later, if nothing refers to it anymore, it becomes garbage, and the GC removes it.

📌 Core Rule: Reachability
A value is garbage collected if it is no longer reachable from the root.

💡 What's "reachable"?
JS starts with some roots:
Global variables (window, global)
Currently running functions
Variables and parameters of current functions
Closures still in scope
If an object is linked to any root, it stays in memory.

Otherwise → 🚮 garbage!

📚 Algorithms Used (Behind the Scenes)

🕸️ Mark and Sweep (main one):
JS engine (e.g., V8) scans the memory.
Marks all reachable values.
Sweeps away unmarked ones.

🔁 Reference Counting (less used):
Keeps a count of references to an object.
If count drops to 0, it is garbage.
⚠️ Not perfect → has issues with circular references.
